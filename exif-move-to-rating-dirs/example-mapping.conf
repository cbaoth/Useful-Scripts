# Example mapping file for exif-move-to-rating-dirs.sh
# Format: SOURCE_PATTERN TARGET_PATH
# - Patterns can use regex (e.g., 5/(Purple|Blue)) or literal strings (e.g., 5/Purple)
# - Quotes (single or double) are optional but required if values contain spaces
# - Comments start with #; blank lines are ignored
# - Patterns are evaluated top-to-bottom; FIRST MATCH WINS
# - Place more specific patterns before general ones (e.g., 5/Purple before 5/.*)
# - Supports regex group substitution: use $1, $2, etc. for captured groups

# Simple direct mappings - consolidate Purple and Blue to just rating directory
5/Purple 5
5/Blue 5
5/None 4

# Regex patterns - match any label in rating 4
4/Purple 3
4/Blue 3
4/None 2

# Regex pattern combining multiple labels
5/(Purple|Blue) 5

# Example with spaces (quoted)
"5/Special Label" "6/Premium"

# Regex group substitution examples
# Keep label with prefix: 5/Purple -> keep-Purple
# 5/(.*) keep-$1

# Use rating in path: 3/Blue -> rating-3
# ([0-5])/.* rating-$1

# Match anything in rating 3 and map to rating 2 (literal target, no substitution)
# Note: This catch-all pattern should come AFTER more specific 3/* patterns
3/.* 2
