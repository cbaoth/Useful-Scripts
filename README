Some (hopefully) useful Bash/Python/.. scripts.

Note that these scripts are made for my personal use, and if they are no longer used by me, I may not update them (if they cease to function). They are often a result of a quick an dirty hack at night and their sole purpose is to do their job, so ... they may not be very pretty.

Main Scripts:
- smfetch.sn   fetch rtmp / http(s) streams from some known (mostly german) tv
               stations and pages like youtube using wget and rtmpdump
- wgetmp.py    fetch multiple files in parallel using wget
- getbyext.sh  fetch all media files (or specific files by ext.) from a given
               url using wget

Some other scripts:
- audio-volume.sh  toggle mute and change volume using hotkeys within the wm
- backup.sh        backup script with exclusion list, supports full and
                   incremental backups
- backup2ftp.sh    capo last backup (made by backup.sh) to an ftp server,
                   preserve previous backup on ftp
- clear-cache.sh   clean up home folder by removing (known) local caches, temp
                   files etc.
- dbbackup.sh      backup script for mysql and postgresql
- gallery.sh       create a very simple image gallery (static html file with
                   static thumbs)
- pdfprint.sh      print a pdf/ps file using psnup for multi page per sheet
                   printing
