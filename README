Some (hopefully) useful Bash/Python/.. scripts.

Note that these scripts are made for my personal use, and if they are no longer used by me, I may not update them (if they cease to function). They are often a result of a quick an dirty hack at night and their sole purpose is to do their job, so ... they may not be very pretty.
